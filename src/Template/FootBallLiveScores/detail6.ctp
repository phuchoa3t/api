We all did, to be honest, it would have given us a chance to push on and get a better finish.</p> <p>“It would have been great to spend millions and attract the best players in the world but the fact is you’re still playing at one of the biggest clubs in the world and for me personally, I wanted to enjoy as much as I could about it.”</p> <h3>What might have been</h3> <p>Things could have panned out so differently had the team snook into the top four ahead of Tottenham.</p> <p>That would have made them a Champions League club (assuming they won their qualifier), in theory making them more desirable to Europe’s most talented players.</p> <p>Ashley may have felt more compelled to invest, and perhaps the struggles of the next few years could have been avoided.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-237613 size-large" src="https://tbrfootball.com/static/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1092660818.jpg" width="1024" height="682"><p class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Michael Regan/Getty Images)</p></div> <p>As it were, Williamson’s ‘hoping for investment’ comments are certainly interesting as not an awful lot has changed since then.</p> <p>Perhaps Miguel Almiron’s recent £20 million <a href="https://www.nufc.co.uk/news/latest-news/magpies-complete-almiron-signing">transfer</a> could be the start of a change though.</p> </div></div> <p></p></body></html>
