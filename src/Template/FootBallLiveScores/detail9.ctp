    </figure> <h4>The inspiration behind the banner</h4> <p>Initially Wor Flags had hoped to set a new world record for the size of a flag unveiled inside a football stadium, but it became clear that such a task would prove impossible given that a Brazilian club performed a display around the circumference of a bowl-shaped stadium.</p> <p>Given that St James' Park has four separate stands, displays are restricted to one section of the ground - but that still makes a European record possible.</p> <p>"Watford supporters unveiled a banner which was the size of the stand behind their goal recently, and we thought: 'If Watford can do that, why can't Newcastle?'" Dan from Wor Flags told Chronicle Live.</p> <p>"Some Watford fans claimed their banner is 85m by 50m, but we're pretty sure that was just to scare us. We think it was roughly 73m by 33m - and we think we can comfortably beat that. We like to think of it as a potential 'world record for a banner in English football'..."</p> <figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" data-observed="false" data-init="true">

    </aside> &nbsp; <h4>A fun element to the flag</h4> <p>Not only do Wor Flags want to celebrate the iconic buildings in the region, they also want to integrate some of the area's inventions into the design too.</p> <p>Newcastle Brown Ale, Joseph Swan's light bulb, George Stephenson's steam engine, Lucozade, and even Domestos, could all feature on the final flag.</p> <p>"We want to create an almost 'Where's Wally' element to the banner, so I'm experimenting with the plans," Dan said.</p> <p> "You won't be able to spot all of these inventions and things the North East is famous for from a distance, but <a href="https://worflags.org.uk/shop/" rel="nofollow">when fans buy replica merchandise</a> they'll be able to look more closely and maybe see a bottle of Brown Ale on the window ledge or whatever." </p> <figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" data-observed="true">

    </figure> <h4>The cost involved - and when it will be unveiled</h4> <p>Donations have been picking up pace in recent weeks, and Wor Flags estimate that they currently have the funds to make a flag which would stretch the full width of the Gallowgate Stand, but only halfway up.</p> <p>The group are waiting for a full quote from the production company they use, but they expect the price to exceed £10,000 - and so they still require donations from supporters.</p> <iframe class="converse-re cre-bottom" width="100%" height="0" frameborder="0" src="https://get.convrse.media?url=http%3A%2F%2F35.231.167.153%2Fnews%2Fdetail%3Furl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fc.newsnow.co.uk%252FA%252F976538720%253F-1841%253A2178&amp;cre=bottom&amp;cip=63" scrolling="no" style="float: left; width: 1px; min-width: 100%;"></iframe><p>In terms of when the flag will be unveiled, it will take at least two months to go through the production process; but, as long as the money is accrued, the banner should be ready to be displayed during the first home match of the 2019/20 campaign.</p> <p>"We had thought about pushing to get the new flag out by the final match of the season against Liverpool, but we opted against it," Dan continued.</p> <p>"We don't want the celebration of all-things Newcastle United to be overshadowed by anybody, and Liverpool could arrive on Tyneside having ended their three-decade wait for a league title.</p> <p>"NUFC deserves celebrating in its own right, and we want something fresh and new which can help kickstart the atmosphere in the new season."</p> <p>If it is ever going to become a reality, then it is over to supporters to ensure the funding arrives...</p>   </div></body></html>
