All the way back to when we lost at Southampton on January 19, and the England U21 international made the last of his three ninety-minute outings of the season so far.</p> <p>What is more worrying is that Lookman has only started a third of his 18 games this season, despite his nearest positional rival being Theo Walcott.</p> <p>If Bernard can continue to hold down the left-wing spot, and Marco Silva switches Richarlison to the right after his impressive cameo there against Liverpool, Lookman’s chances of breaking into the Portuguese’s side will only be dented further.</p> <p>For someone with as much potential as the Englishman, he needs game time to prove his worth, otherwise, the doubts over his future will continue to grow.</p> <p>Here’s what is currently being said on the <a href="https://www.grandoldteam.com/forum/threads/ademola-lookman.104361/page-432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Grand Old Team </em></a>forum…</p> <p><em>“Just seems like one of those players with a terrible attitude to me.”</em> – <strong><em>Killenefc (<a href="https://www.grandoldteam.com/forum/threads/ademola-lookman.104361/page-431">March 5, 08:14</a>)</em></strong></p> <p><em>“We had 7 subs Sunday and he </em>cant<em> even get on the bench, so he is down to at least 19th man. I didn’t see the need to have two defenders on the bench for the Derby, when Lookman could have offered an extra threat going forward by being a sub”</em> – <strong><em>Gaffa (<a href="https://www.grandoldteam.com/forum/threads/ademola-lookman.104361/page-431">March 5, 09:02</a>)</em></strong></p> <p><em>“He was bought from Charlton to make a step up which requires some game time. No manager since has played him with any regularity, in </em>fact<em> they have brought in multiple other players for his position all of whom are given a game before him.”</em> – <strong><em>Lord Buckethead (<a href="https://www.grandoldteam.com/forum/threads/ademola-lookman.104361/page-431">March 5, 09:06</a>)</em></strong></p> <p><em>“It’s just so strange that last month he seemed to have made it to the 1st team ahead of Walcott now he’s out of the squad? This is the only major criticism I have of Silva, that his ‘rotation’ or ‘chopping and changing’ doesn’t seem to have any strategy.”</em> – <strong><em>APN_EFC (<a href="https://www.grandoldteam.com/forum/threads/ademola-lookman.104361/page-431">March 5, 09:06</a>)</em></strong></p> <p><em>“</em>Lookman<em> is a young lad with a variable impact on games. Seems to be more prone to dips in confidence and form than the average young player. He should just keep working hard and the rewards will come. RBL suited him because he was generally playing cameo roles for one of the better teams in a league.”</em> – <strong><em>Berenger (<a href="https://www.grandoldteam.com/forum/threads/ademola-lookman.104361/page-431">March 5, 09:19</a>)</em></strong></p> <p><em>“How do you know he actually wants to play for us?
