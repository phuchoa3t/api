They could see a relegation as just a temporary obstacle that would just delay them in moving the club towards success, using their massive wealth.</p> <p>However, that is clearly not the case here, if you really believe Mike Ashley is interested in selling Newcastle United and you believe Peter Kenyon is struggling to raise the money from investors.</p> <p>If we did accept these things as true, then you have to bear in mind that people would only ever be investing in the hope of making a profit in X years time. On that basis it is impossible to see any consortium and especially smaller investors, risking their money at this point, in what is basically a no-win gamble.</p> <p>Say that you believe all the previous reports on Mike Ashley willing to sell, but only at his £300m valuation, AND you believe Peter Kenyon is leading a bid and welcoming all levels of investors…Why on earth would they risk money at this point?</p> <p>If the club stays in the Premier League it would still be valued at £300m (how can you believe it could be more than that when you look at how much work needs to be done???).</p> <!-- Ezoic - MW16_Advert_Code_Four - long_content --> <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-684"></span> <!-- End Ezoic - MW16_Advert_Code_Four - long_content --> <p>If the club is bought now for £300m and it ended up being relegated, then it would be worth probably around £150m-£200m.</p> <p>So the imaginary Peter Kenyon millionaire club investors, would immediately become half a millionaire (value) investors.</p> <p>For what it is worth, I think it is laughable the idea that any takeover is going to happen during this season, if ever…</p> <p>The Sun:</p> <p><em>‘Desperate Peter Kenyon is appealing to investors to back his Newcastle takeover attempt – by offering them a minimum buy-in of just £1million.</em></p> <p><em>The ex-Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive is still searching for the £300m needed to complete his purchase of the Toon.</em></p> <p><em>And SunSport has learned that Kenyon is so anxious he is now doing a whip-round of anyone able to cough up a seven-figure sum.Even then, the British businessman would only be able to pay Toon owner Mike Ashley in instalments staggered over the rest of the year.</em></p> <p><em>But Kenyon is buoyed by Ashley viewing him as the “best fit” to buy the club.And he is determined to get a deal over the line by any means possible, having spent weeks looking over Newcastle’s books and working with lawyers.</em></p> <p><em>Kenyon’s struggle to meet Ashley’s asking price, however, does raise doubts about his suitability for St James’ Park.</em></p> <p><em>When Ashley put Newcastle up for sale in October 2017, he claimed a new owner must have the investment necessary to take the club to the “next level”.’</em><br><!-- Ezoic - MW14_Advert_Code_Two - mid_content --> <span id="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-682"></span> <!-- End Ezoic - MW14_Advert_Code_Two - mid_content --></p> <!-- Article End --> <p></p></body></html>
