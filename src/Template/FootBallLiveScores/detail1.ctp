But it’s worked in the players’ favour because they’ve had the support and a really strong backing from the fans.</p> <p>“There always is here at Celtic but there’s an extra bit here just now.</p> <p>“We’ve all felt it around the place and the players have fed off that, especially going away to Hearts and Hibs where it’s always difficult.</p> <p>“Hopefully on Saturday against Aberdeen it’ll be a great atmosphere that the players can thrive on.”</p> <!-- TRACKING START GA --><!-- TRACKING END GA --><p></p></body></html>
